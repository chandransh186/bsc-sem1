# First Semester C Programs

Welcome to the repository containing the C programs developed during the first semester of the B.Sc. in Computer Science at Doon University. This collection represents foundational exercises aimed at building a strong understanding of C programming concepts. The programs cover the following topics:

- **Variables and Data Types**  
- **Control Structures (if, else, switch, loops)**  
- **Functions and Recursion**  
- **Arrays and Strings**  
- **Pointers and Memory Management**  
- **Basic File I/O**  
- **Simple Algorithms and Problem Solving**

## Getting Started

To get started with the programs in this repository, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandransh186/first-semester-c-programs.git

2. **Navigate to the program directory**  
   After cloning the repository, change to the program directory:
   ```bash
   cd first-semester-c-programs
3. **Compile the C program**  
   To compile a program, use a C compiler like GCC. Replace `program_name.c` with the filename of the program you want to compile. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
This command will generate an executable file named program_name that can be run in your terminal.

4. **Run the compiled program**  
   After successfully compiling the program, you can run the executable with the following command:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
This will execute the program and display the output in your terminal.
